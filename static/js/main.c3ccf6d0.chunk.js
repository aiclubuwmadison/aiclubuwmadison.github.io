How does that happen in the brain? Evidence suggests that brains implement predictive processing schemes, making use of neural circuitry to implement predictive coding in the service of efficiency. Yet the evidence is largely circumstantial, and fundamental questions remain open. I will present some of the evidence from my lab and others' for predictive processing in the brain, and show how we are exploring the relationship between predictive processing and consciousness."),r.a.createElement(O,{file:"billHibbard.jpg",date:"March 13th in CS 1240",title:"Bill Hibbard | Coming of Age with AI"},"Technology changes constantly and rapidly. A technology career requires lifelong learning. Constant change enables new uses of technology and career opportunities for those who develop those uses. Recently computers have become powerful enough to make artificial neural networks useful, enabling many new applications. AI and automation are transforming labor markets, AI is transforming medicine, warfare and other fields, and AI connected via the Internet to billions of people is transforming society. There is a good chance of reaching human-level AI, and beyond, within the next few decades, which will greatly accelerate these transformations. AI students in 2019 will be part of these transformations and will be at the center of the political storm they create. AI developers will need a clear understanding of what they value to weather the storm. This will be a short talk followed by a longer open discussion."),r.a.createElement(O,{file:"josephAusterweil.jpg",date:"April 10th in CS 1240",title:"Joe Austerweil | Do people teach others as if they are reinforcement learners?"},"Humans teach others in a variety of ways. Although people often teach others through verbal description, people also teach using nonverbal means. For example, a parent might punish their child for not taking off her muddy shoes before walking on the carpet. Or, a baseball pitching coach might teach a new type of pitch by demonstrating the sequence of arm and leg movements to produce it. In this talk, I will discuss three different forms of nonverbal teaching: teaching by evaluative feedback (or reinforcement), teaching by demonstration, and teaching by intervention. In all three cases, I will present evidence that teachers expect learners to interpret nonverbal teaching as communication. I will discuss implications for artificial intelligence and machine learning research, where reward-maximizing is often an assumption of the model."));var B=function(){return r.a.createElement("div",null,r.a.createElement(o.a,null,r.a.createElement(d,null),r.a.createElement("div",{id:"body-wrapper"},r.a.createElement(s.c,null,r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"/about"},r.a.createElement(I,null),r.a.createElement(E,null)),r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"/involvement"},r.a.createElement(S,null),r.a.createElement(E,null)),r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"/leadership"},r.a.createElement(M,null),r.a.createElement(E,null)),r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"/contact"},r.a.createElement(W,null),r.a.createElement(E,null)),r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"/seminars"},r.a.createElement(D,null),r.a.createElement(E,null)),r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"/study"},r.a.createElement(F,null),r.a.createElement(E,null)),r.a.createElement(s.a,{path:"/"},r.a.createElement(b,null))))))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));i.a.render(r.a.createElement(r.a.StrictMode,null,r.a.createElement(B,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(e=>{e.unregister()}).catch(e=>{console.error(e.message)})}},[[52,1,2]]]);
