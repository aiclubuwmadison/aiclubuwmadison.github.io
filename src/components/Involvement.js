                <Subheader> Leader </Subheader>
                <BodyText>
                    <p>Far from just a resume booster, this is a great opportunity to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Work with other students who share your passion for AI research/technology</li>
                        <li>Make connections in industry and research</li>
                        <li>Contribute to something larger than yourself and leave your mark at UW-Madison</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
                    If you're part of the leadership team, you're part of shaping the org. As one of our club's leaders, you'll be expected to
                    bring new ideas to our regular meetings that help contribute to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>AI-related learning opportunities (e.g. assisting project managers and study group leaders)</li>
                        <li>Events (e.g. recruiting guest speakers, helping organize contests)</li>
                        <li>Club content/growth (flyers/newsletters, posting to community FYI channels, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Qualifications</h4>
                    It is not necessary to be an expert in AI--just a student who wants to see their ideas realized with the help of an
                    awesome team of fellow volunteers.
                    <h4>Application Instructions</h4>
                    If interested, please email us at <a href="mailto:aiclubuwmadison@gmail.com">aiclubuwmadison@gmail.com</a> with a resume/CV and brief note (5-10 sentences) explaining
                    how/why you would make a great addition to our team.</p>
