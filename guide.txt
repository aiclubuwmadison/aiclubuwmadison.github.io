AI@UW Website Master Building Guide for new peeps and/or webmasters.

Overall: Edit website in dev branch, push it and then build the file,  and push it to masters:

clone, then npm install and npm start in parent dir(dont worry abt backend). and test/debug/update.

after everything works npm run build and npx serve -s build to check if build it loading properly. then below steps to push to master.

- first push commit dev if everything is working as expected(ensure proper add files).

to save hash before pushing to master. save hash
git rev-parse origin/master 

1. in master copy build into prevous dir:
cp -r build/ ../temp_build/

2. go to master
git checkout master

3. rem all files:
rm -rf *

4. cp the build file into the branch
cp -r ../temp_build/* .

5. then commit push
git add . 
git commit -m "Update built files" 
	check branch then normal git push. if that dont work then below:
git push origin master

6. remove temp build if you want.
rm -rf ../temp_build/

(feel free to ignore this as well - its how i kept store of the hash's. you can git's built in feature as well.)
